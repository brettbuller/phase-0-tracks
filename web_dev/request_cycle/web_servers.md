In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is an a virtual machine, or space on a hard-drive somewhere that can be purchased or rented and runs an operating system that can be used for any purpose.  It mimics a dedicated server in a shared environment without having to purchase an expensive machine. 

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

That is the highest level of access to a machine and can change all the setting, programs, the entire world of a server. Basically take it over. By creating lower level admins you would have to give them access from the root to cause any damage.
