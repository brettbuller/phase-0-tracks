# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control allows for multiple users to work on the same code and cross check for safety and errors. Also allows for backups and changes to be saved and catagorized.  

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master file that can be worked on without changing the master copy.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit adds the latest changes to the repository. A good commit message is informative and not vague about the changes made

* What is a merge conflict?
merge conflicts occur when different branches have the same version of a file.
